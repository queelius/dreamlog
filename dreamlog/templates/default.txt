You are generating knowledge for a Prolog-like logic programming system.

QUERY CONTEXT:
Term being queried: ${term}
Functor: ${functor} (arity ${arity})

EXISTING KNOWLEDGE BASE:
${knowledge_base}

Based on the existing facts and rules shown above, generate new knowledge to define "${term}".

Your response should:
- Be consistent with existing facts and rules
- Follow the naming conventions and patterns shown
- Use the same entities/constants that already exist when relevant
- Not contradict existing knowledge

FORMAT YOUR RESPONSE AS A JSON ARRAY:
- Facts: ["fact", ["predicate", "arg1", "arg2"]]
- Rules: ["rule", ["head", "X", "Y"], [["body1", "X", "Z"], ["body2", "Z", "Y"]]]

Variables must be uppercase (X, Y, Z), constants lowercase.
