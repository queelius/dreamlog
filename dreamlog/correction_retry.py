TASK: Generate a CORRECT rule for '{functor}'.

Learn from your previous mistakes:
- Pay attention to the order of arguments
- Make sure the logic flows correctly
- Verify that the relationship is defined properly
- Use the predicates in the knowledge base correctly

IMPORTANT: Think step by step about the logic before generating the rule.

Example of common mistakes:
- ancestor(X, Y) :- parent(Z, Y), grandparent(X, Z).  [WRONG - backwards logic]
- ancestor(X, Y) :- parent(X, Y).                      [CORRECT - base case]
- ancestor(X, Y) :- parent(X, Z), ancestor(Z, Y).      [CORRECT - recursive case]
