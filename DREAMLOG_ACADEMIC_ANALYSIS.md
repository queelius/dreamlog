# DreamLog: A Hybrid Neural-Symbolic Architecture with Wake-Sleep Learning Cycles

## Abstract

We present DreamLog, a novel logic programming system that integrates symbolic reasoning with neural language models through a biologically-inspired wake-sleep architecture. The system addresses the fundamental tension between the rigid deductive capabilities of logic programming and the flexible but imprecise nature of neural networks. DreamLog employs Large Language Models (LLMs) for dynamic knowledge generation during "wake" phases when encountering undefined predicates, while implementing compression-based learning during "sleep" phases to discover more efficient knowledge representations. This architecture realizes key principles from algorithmic information theory, particularly the equivalence between compression and learning posited by Solomonoff induction. We demonstrate how this hybrid approach enables continuous learning, knowledge consolidation, and the emergence of compositional abstractions that neither purely symbolic nor purely neural systems achieve independently.

## 1. Introduction

The dichotomy between symbolic and connectionist approaches to artificial intelligence has persisted since the field's inception. Logic programming systems excel at precise reasoning, compositionality, and interpretability but struggle with incomplete knowledge and brittleness. Neural networks demonstrate remarkable pattern recognition and generalization capabilities but lack explicit reasoning mechanisms and suffer from opacity. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have reignited interest in neural-symbolic integration, yet most approaches treat these paradigms as separate modules rather than fundamentally integrated systems.

DreamLog represents a paradigm shift in neural-symbolic integration by implementing a wake-sleep architecture inspired by mammalian memory consolidation processes. During wake phases, the system operates as a traditional logic programming engine enhanced with LLM-based knowledge generation for undefined predicates. During sleep phases, it employs compression algorithms to discover more efficient representations, implementing the insight from algorithmic information theory that the shortest description of data constitutes optimal learning.

### 1.1 Key Contributions

1. **Algorithmic Information Theoretic Foundation**: We formalize the relationship between logic program compression and generalization through the lens of Kolmogorov complexity and Solomonoff induction.

2. **Wake-Sleep Learning Architecture**: A novel implementation of consolidation cycles that alternates between exploitation (wake) and exploration (sleep), analogous to REM and non-REM sleep phases in biological systems.

3. **Dynamic Knowledge Generation**: Integration of LLMs as a generative prior for missing knowledge, treating undefined predicates as opportunities for learning rather than failures.

4. **Compression as Meta-Learning**: Demonstration that rule compression during sleep phases constitutes a form of meta-learning, discovering compositional primitives that improve both efficiency and generalization.

## 2. Theoretical Framework

### 2.1 Solomonoff Induction and Program Compression

The theoretical foundation of DreamLog rests on Solomonoff's theory of inductive inference, which provides a mathematical formalization of Occam's razor. Given a set of observations $D$, the probability of a hypothesis $h$ is:

$$P(h|D) \propto 2^{-K(h)} \cdot \mathbb{1}[h \text{ explains } D]$$

where $K(h)$ represents the Kolmogorov complexity of hypothesis $h$. In the context of logic programming, hypotheses are sets of facts and rules, and "explaining" data means deriving observed facts through logical inference.

DreamLog operationalizes this principle by treating the knowledge base as a compression problem. The sleep phase searches for minimal representations that preserve deductive closure:

$$\text{minimize } |KB'| \text{ subject to } \text{Closure}(KB') = \text{Closure}(KB)$$

where $|KB'|$ measures the description length of the knowledge base and $\text{Closure}(\cdot)$ denotes the set of all derivable facts.

### 2.2 Neural Networks as Approximate Oracles

We model the LLM component as an approximate oracle $\mathcal{O}: \mathcal{T} \rightarrow \mathcal{P}(\mathcal{KB})$ that maps terms to probability distributions over knowledge base fragments. This oracle embodies:

1. **Implicit Prior Knowledge**: The LLM's training corpus provides a prior over plausible facts and rules
2. **Compositional Generalization**: Transformer architectures exhibit emergent compositional capabilities
3. **Uncertainty Quantification**: Token probabilities provide confidence estimates for generated knowledge

The key insight is that LLMs approximate the universal prior in Solomonoff induction, biased by human-generated text rather than pure simplicity.

### 2.3 Wake-Sleep Dynamics

The system alternates between two phases with distinct objectives:

**Wake Phase** (Exploitation):
- Query evaluation using SLD resolution
- LLM invocation for undefined predicates
- Knowledge accumulation without reorganization
- Objective: Maximize query answering capability

**Sleep Phase** (Exploration):
- Rule generalization through anti-unification
- Redundancy elimination via subsumption checking
- Discovery of compositional primitives
- Objective: Minimize description length while preserving semantics

This alternation implements the exploration-exploitation tradeoff fundamental to reinforcement learning and optimization.

## 3. System Architecture

### 3.1 Core Components

DreamLog consists of four primary subsystems:

1. **Symbolic Reasoning Engine**: Traditional SLD resolution with backtracking
2. **LLM Integration Layer**: Manages neural knowledge generation
3. **Sleep Cycle Manager**: Orchestrates compression and reorganization
4. **Persistent Knowledge Base**: Dual-KB architecture for learned vs. user knowledge

### 3.2 Knowledge Representation

The system uses S-expressions as its primary syntax, providing a uniform representation for facts and rules:

```
(parent john mary)
(grandparent X Z) :- (parent X Y), (parent Y Z)
```

This representation facilitates:
- Easy parsing and manipulation
- Direct mapping to tree structures for compression algorithms
- Natural integration with LLM-generated text

### 3.3 LLM Hook Mechanism

When the evaluator encounters an undefined predicate, it triggers the LLM hook:

```python
def on_undefined(term, evaluator):
    context = extract_relevant_knowledge(evaluator.kb, term)
    prompt = construct_prompt(term, context)
    response = llm.generate(prompt)
    new_knowledge = parse_response(response)
    evaluator.kb.add(new_knowledge)
```

The hook maintains a cache to avoid redundant generation and implements retry logic with exponential backoff.

## 4. Learning Dynamics

### 4.1 Compression-Based Generalization

During sleep phases, DreamLog employs several compression strategies:

**Anti-Unification**: Given facts:
```
(parent john mary)
(parent bob alice)
```
The system might generate:
```
(parent X Y) :- (biological_parent X Y)
```

**Predicate Invention**: Discovery of intermediate concepts that simplify multiple rules:
```
Before: (grandparent X Z) :- (parent X Y), (parent Y Z)
        (great_grandparent X W) :- (parent X Y), (parent Y Z), (parent Z W)
        
After:  (ancestor X Y 1) :- (parent X Y)
        (ancestor X Z N) :- (parent X Y), (ancestor Y Z M), (succ M N)
        (grandparent X Y) :- (ancestor X Y 2)
```

**Subsumption Elimination**: Removing specific rules subsumed by more general ones.

### 4.2 Verification and Consistency

The system maintains semantic equivalence through verification:

1. **Deductive Closure Preservation**: Ensuring all previously derivable facts remain derivable
2. **Query Equivalence Testing**: Validating that test queries produce identical results
3. **Incremental Verification**: Checking each transformation independently

### 4.3 Convergence Properties

The compression process exhibits interesting convergence properties:

**Theorem 1**: Under mild assumptions, the sleep phase compression converges to a local minimum in description length.

**Proof Sketch**: The compression operators (anti-unification, subsumption) monotonically decrease description length while preserving deductive closure. Since description length is bounded below by the Kolmogorov complexity of the knowledge, the process must converge.

2. **The Role of Sleep**: Does biological sleep serve a similar compression function?
3. **Symbolic Emergence**: Can symbols emerge from neural substrates through compression?

## 10. Conclusion

DreamLog represents a significant step toward unified neural-symbolic systems that leverage the complementary strengths of both paradigms. By grounding the architecture in algorithmic information theory and drawing inspiration from biological learning processes, we provide both theoretical foundations and practical mechanisms for continuous learning systems.

The wake-sleep architecture offers a principled approach to the exploration-exploitation dilemma while the compression-based learning framework provides measurable objectives for knowledge organization. As LLMs continue to improve, systems like DreamLog may bridge the gap between the flexibility of neural approaches and the rigor of symbolic reasoning.

The project opens numerous avenues for future research, from theoretical investigations into compression-generalization relationships to practical applications in automated reasoning and knowledge discovery. Most importantly, it suggests that the long-standing divide between symbolic and connectionist AI may be reconciled through architectures that alternate between different modes of processing, much like the biological systems that inspired them.
